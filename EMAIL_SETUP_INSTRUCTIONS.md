# Contact Form Setup Instructions

I've created a contact form that will log submissions and can be extended to send emails to patrick@vouchprofile.com.

## Current Status ✅

The contact form is now working and will:

- ✅ Validate form inputs (name, email, message)
- ✅ Log all submissions to your server console
- ✅ Show success message to users
- ✅ Store submission data with timestamps

## What's Working Now

1. **Contact Button**: Fixed position button (bottom-right) with mail icon
2. **Contact Form**: Modal with Name, Email, Message fields + validation
3. **API Endpoint**: `/api/contact` route in your Express server
4. **Logging**: All submissions logged to console with timestamps
5. **User Feedback**: Success/error messages

## To Add Email Sending (Optional)

### Option 1: Use Make.com (Recommended for your setup)

Since you're already using Make.com webhooks, you can:

1. **Create a new Make.com scenario**:

   - Webhook trigger to receive contact form data
   - Email module to send to patrick@vouchprofile.com

2. **Add environment variable**:

   - Set `CONTACT_WEBHOOK_URL` in your Fly.dev environment
   - Point it to your new Make.com webhook URL

3. **The API will automatically use it** when the env var is present

### Option 2: Direct Email Service

Alternatively, you can modify `/server/index.ts` to use:

- Resend API
- SendGrid
- Mailgun
- Or any other email service

## Testing

The contact form is ready to test now:

1. Click the contact button (bottom-right mail icon)
2. Fill out the form
3. Submit and check your server logs for the submission data

## Server Logs

Check your Fly.dev logs to see contact form submissions:

```bash
fly logs
```

You'll see entries like:

```
Contact form submission: {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@example.com",
  comment: "Great product!",
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

The form is fully functional and ready for production use!
